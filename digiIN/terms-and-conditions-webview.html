However, we have adopted the mode of authentication by means of verification of the Security Code, Soft Token ID or through any other mode of verification as may be stipulated at our discretion, which may or may not be recognised under the Information Technology Act, 2000 for authentication of electronic records. Therefore you are solely responsible to maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Security Code without any liability on DBS in this regard.</li>

                                        <p> Your Debit Card is extremely versatile and simple to use.

                                        <ol type="a">
                                          <li> Look for a Visa sign at the Point-of-Sale merchant establishment. The merchant must have an Electron Point-of-Sale card swiping terminal.</li>
                                          <li> Present your Debit Card after making your purchase.</li>
                                          <li> The Debit Card will be swiped by the merchant on a Visa Electron Data Capture Terminal for authorisation.</li>
                                          <li> Enter your ATM PIN for authorisation.</li>
                                          <li> After a successful authorisation, a hold for the transacted amount will first be placed on your digiSavings. Your digiSavings will subsequently be debited for the transacted amount.</li>
                                          <li> A sales slip will be generated.</li>
                                          <li> Check and sign the sales slip, if required by the Merchant. Your signature must match with that on the reverse of the Card.</li>
                                          <li> Ensure your Debit Card is returned to you.</li>
                                          <li> Preserve your copy of the sales slip for future reference.</li>
                                          <li> Subject to availability of balance in your digiSavings, a per day limit of such amount as may be determined by the Bank from time to time, will be set for usage of your Debit Card at merchant outlets. When the Debit Card is used at a merchant establishment, the purchase amount will always be debited from the digiSavings.</li>
                                          <li> Do note that since signature/PIN verification is required for Debit Card transactions, you need to be physically present along with your Debit Card at the time of purchase. Debit Card cannot be used for mail order and telephone order transactions.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p> Debit Card is accepted only at all Visa supported Point-of-Sale terminals at merchant establishments in India and overseas, which display the Visa logo. You must sign the sales slip and retain your copy of the sales slip whenever the Debit Card is used at merchant establishments. We will not furnish copies of the sales slip. Any sales slip not personally signed by you but which can be proven, as being authorised by you will be deemed to be your liability.</p>
                                        <p> We will not accept any responsibility for any dealings the merchant may have with you, including but not limited to the supply of goods and services so availed or offered. Should you have any complaint relating to any Visa supported Card merchant establishment, you will resolve the matter with the merchant establishment and failure to do so will not relieve you from any obligations to us. If you decide to cancel your purchase and not accept the goods after the Debit Card is swiped, ensure that the merchant cancels the transaction immediately and the cancellation slip is handed over to you. Any cancellation thereafter will be routed as a &#39;chargeback&#39; on the merchant through the acquiring bank and will take the time required to complete the process. There can be no guarantee of full/partial return of the amount.</p>
                                        <p> We accept no responsibility for any charges levied by any merchant establishment over and above the value/cost of transactions and debited to your Account along with the transaction amount.</p>
                                        <p> A purchase and a subsequent credit for cancellation of goods/services are two separate transactions. The refund will only be credited to your digiSavings (less cancellation charges) as and when it is received from the merchant. If the credit is not posted to your digiSavings within 30 days from the date of cancellation, you must notify us, along with a copy of the cancellation slip from the merchant.</p>
                                        <p> Debit Card should not be used for any mail order/phone purchases and any such usage will be considered as unauthorised and you will be liable for all cost and consequences arising or relating thereto.</p>
                                        <h5 id="5.11">5.11 International Usage</h5>
                                        <p> Your Debit Card is accepted at DBS Bank ATMs and at Visa ATMs in India and abroad. Your Debit Card is not valid for payment in foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan.</p>
                                        <p><strong> Please Note:</strong> In case of international cash withdrawal transactions, the applicable exchange rates and fees will be levied.</p>
                                        <p> Utilisation of the Debit Card must be in strict accordance with the Exchange Control Regulations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prevailing from time to time. In the event of your failure to do so, you will be liable for action under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA) as may be amended or replaced from time to time and may be debarred from holding a Debit Card either at the instance of the Bank or RBI. You will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any/all consequences arising from you not complying with Exchange Control regulations. At the time of cash withdrawal at Visa ATMs while abroad the screen will display 3 options for account selection - 1) Savings 2) Checking 3) Credit. Please choose the <strong>&quot;Checking&quot;</strong> option, as this option hits the Visa network. In some countries you may have to choose the <strong>&quot;Credit&quot;</strong> option.</p>
                                        <p> At a few Merchant establishments abroad (especially in the United States of America), you may have to ask the cashier to swipe your Debit Card as a credit card. This is because in some countries <strong>&quot;Debit&quot;</strong> is connected only to the local network and the transaction may be declined, as it will not reach the Visa network. Your Debit Card will continue to function as a Debit Card.</p>
